Food Item Categorization Model
Overview:

This project aims to categorize food items based on various features such as cuisine, preparation method, and nutrient values. The system takes a food item name as input and provides detailed information about the dish.
**Objectives:**

  **Automated Categorization:**
        Enable automatic categorization of food items into various classes based on multiple features.

  **User-Friendly Interface:**
        Provide a simple interface for users to input a dish name and receive detailed information about the dish.

   **Dietary Recommendations:**
        Suggest suitable dishes for different age groups based on nutrient values, promoting healthy eating habits.

  **Multi-Algorithms Approach:**
        Implement a combination of algorithms, including Naive Bayes, SVM, RNN, and CNN, to handle diverse types of input data.

**Algorithms Used:**

   **Naive Bayes Classifier:**
   
        Probabilistic algorithm for text classification.
        
        Application: Categorizing food items based on textual information.


   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
       
        Effective for classification tasks with clear category separation.
        
        Application: Categorizing food items based on various features.

  **Decision Trees**

         Usage: Hierarchical categorization based on features like spice level and cuisine.
         Training Data: Dataset with food features (e.g., spice level, cuisine) and categories.

  **Random Forest**

        Usage: Ensemble of decision trees for robust categorization.
        Training Data: Similar to Decision Trees.

  **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

       Usage: Item categorization based on similarity.
       Training Data: Dataset with features and categories.

  **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

       Usage: Effective for clear separation between categories.
       Training Data: Dataset with features and categories.


   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - LSTM:**
   
        Neural network for sequential data.
   
        Application: Learning patterns in sequences of textual information.


   **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
   
        Deep learning model for image processing tasks.
        
        Application: Learning hierarchical features from dish images.

**Data Processing:**

   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
   
        Techniques for processing and analyzing natural language text.
        
        Tokenization using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.

**Model Training:**

   **Dataset:**
   
        The model is trained on the 'IndianFood.xlsx' dataset containing food item names and associated features.

Usage:

  **Input:**
        Provide a food item name.

   **Prediction:**
        The model predicts various attributes:
            Cuisine
            Preparation Method
            Nutrient Values

   **Output:**
        Detailed information about the input food item, including suggested dietary recommendations.
