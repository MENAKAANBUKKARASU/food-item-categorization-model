Food Item Categorization Model
Overview:

This project aims to categorize food items based on various features such as cuisine, preparation method, and nutrient values. The system takes a food item name as input and provides detailed information about the dish.
Algorithms Used:

    Naive Bayes Classifier:
        Probabilistic algorithm for text classification.
        Application: Categorizing food items based on textual information.

    Support Vector Machines (SVM):
        Effective for classification tasks with clear category separation.
        Application: Categorizing food items based on various features.

    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) - LSTM:
        Neural network for sequential data.
        Application: Learning patterns in sequences of textual information.

    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
        Deep learning model for image processing tasks.
        Application: Learning hierarchical features from dish images.

Data Processing:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP):
        Techniques for processing and analyzing natural language text.
        Tokenization using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.

Model Training:

    Dataset:
        The model is trained on the 'IndianFood.xlsx' dataset containing food item names and associated features.

Usage:

    Input:
        Provide a food item name.

    Prediction:
        The model predicts various attributes:
            Cuisine
            Preparation Method
            Nutrient Values

    Output:
        Detailed information about the input food item, including suggested dietary recommendations.
